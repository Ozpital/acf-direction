# ACF Direction Field

A visual direction select

-----------------------

### Description

This plugin will provide a visual direction select box which outputs one of the following values:
- up-left
- up-center
- up-right
- left
- center
- right
- down-left
- down-center
- down-right

I created this plugin to allow clients to set their own background-position but didn't want to limit it to that function.

This ACF field type is compatible with:
* ACF 5

### Installation

1. Copy the `acf-direction` folder into your `wp-content/plugins` folder
2. Activate the acf-direction plugin via the plugins admin page
3. Create a new field via ACF and select the 'Direction' type
4. Please refer to the description for more info regarding the field type settings
